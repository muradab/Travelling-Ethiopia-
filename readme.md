# Traveling Ethiopia App

This Dart application helps users find paths between cities in Ethiopia using various search strategies including Uniform Cost Search, Greedy BFS (Best-First Search), and A\* Search.

## Prerequisites

- Dart SDK: Ensure that [Dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart) is installed on your machine.

## Installation

To run this app, clone the repository or download the source code. Navigate to the project directory using your command line tool.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/muradab/Travelling-Ethiopia-.git
cd your-repository
Usage
To run the program, ensure you are in the project directory and execute:

Copy
dart run
This will start the application in the command line interface. Follow the prompts on the screen to select from available cities and choose among the implemented search strategies.

Inputs
Start City: Enter the name of the city from where you want to start.
-Goal City: Enter the destination city you wish to find a path to.

Search Strategy: You need to specify the search strategy you want to use. Available options are:
UniformCost: For Uniform Cost Search
Greenter_BFS: The '''Greedy Best:first refers to search
aA`: Using the A search algorithm
If you wish to stop the application, enter exit when prompted for the start city.


Available cities: Addis Ababa, Adama, Bahir Dar, ...
Enter start city or type "exit" to quit: Addis Ababa
Enter goal city: Bahir Dar
Choose strategy (Uniform_Costs='Greenterller;_={`/;}. a*: *)
